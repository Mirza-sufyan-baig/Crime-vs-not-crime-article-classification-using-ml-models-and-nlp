# Crime-vs-not-crime-article-classification-using-ml-models-and-nlp
This project focuses on classifying news articles as either “Crime” or “Not Crime” based on their textual content. The project explores and compares multiple machine learning approaches: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and a Stacking Classifier (combining Logistic Regression, Complement Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree).
